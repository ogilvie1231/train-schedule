<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The train scheduler allows you to add a new train. Once you have added your train, the destination, arrival time and frequency of the train, your train will be added to the list. The information about your train will be displayed at the top. All the information you submit will be displayed as well as what time the next train will arrive and how many minutes until then. Using Firebase all the information is kept live.</p>
